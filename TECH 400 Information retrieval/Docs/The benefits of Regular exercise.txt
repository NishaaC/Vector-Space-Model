Regular physical activity is crucial for maintaining physical and mental health. Engaging in sports and fitness activities can reduce the risk of heart disease, improve muscle strength, and enhance mental clarity. Exercise also releases endorphins, which boost mood and reduce stress. Incorporating strength training, cardio, and flexibility exercises into a routine helps individuals stay healthy and energized.
