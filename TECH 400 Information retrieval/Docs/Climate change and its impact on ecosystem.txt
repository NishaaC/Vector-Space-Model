Climate change poses a significant threat to ecosystems around the world. Rising temperatures, melting glaciers, and extreme weather events disrupt natural habitats, endangering wildlife. Shifts in climate patterns lead to loss of biodiversity, and certain species are struggling to adapt. Sustainable practices like reducing carbon emissions, protecting forests, and conserving water are critical in mitigating these effects.
